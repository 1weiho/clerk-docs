# Invitations

Clerk makes it easy to invite users to your application via the invitations feature. This feature is offered by default to all Clerk applications without any extra configuration. Currently, Clerk supports inviting users via email.

Inviting users to your application begins with creating an invitation for an email address. Once the invitation is created, an email with an invitation link will be sent to the user's email address. By clicking on the invitation link, the user will be redirected to the application's sign up page and their email address will have been automatically verified. At this point, the user will just have to fill in the rest of the details according to the application's settings.

Invitations expire after a month. If the user clicks on an expired invitation, they will get redirected to the application's sign-up page but they will still have to go via the normal sign-up flow, i.e. their email address will not be auto-verified.

<Callout type="info">
  Invitations are only used to invite users to your application. The application will still be available to everyone even without an invitation.If you're looking into creating invitation-only applications, please refer to our [restrictions](/docs/authentication/configuration/restrictions) options.

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk) guide.

## Creating invitations

At the moment, you can only create invitations for email addresses via the [Backend API](/docs/references/backend/overview).
