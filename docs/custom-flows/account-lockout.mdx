# Account lockout

Account lockout is a Clerk feature that enables you to protect your users from brute-force attacks on static credentials such as:

* passwords
* backup codes

If enabled on your instance, Clerk will automatically track users' failed verification attempts when they try to authenticate via password on backup code.

If the maximum allowed attempts are reached, the user will be locked out from signing in again until the lockout duration lapses.
Lockout can also be configured to never expire, in which case the user will not be able to sign in unless an admin unlocks them.

An admin can [unlock a user before the expiry of the lockout period](/docs/authentication/configuration/lockout#override-a-lockout) via the Clerk dashboard.

<Callout type="info">
Self-service unlock is not yet available, i.e. users cannot currently unlock their own account or submit a request to the admin to be unlocked. This is an upcoming feature, so please check our [changelog](/blog) periodically to be informed once it is available.
</Callout>

## Unlocking a user programmatically

You can programmatically unlock a user using the [UnlockUser](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/LockUser) Backend API operation.

### Use cases

* Your custom sign-in page could expose a button or link to request an unlock token when they are locked out of their account
    * Your app should be able to generate a random unlock token and associate it with the user
    * The unlock token can be sent to the user via email or SMS
    * After successful entry of the unlock token, your app's backend can issue an unlock request to the Clerk Backend API
* If your app supports users submitting admin requests, it could expose a way of requesting an admin unlock
    * A request for unlock could arrive in your app's admin dashboard
    * If an admin reviews the request and decides to grant access back to the user, they can request an unlock from your app's backend, which should in turn call the Clerk Backend API

## Locking a user programmatically

You can programmatically lock a user based on your own custom criteria, e.g. if they are violating your app's code of conduct.

You can do so via the [LockUser](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/LockUser) Backend API operation. Keep in mind that Clerk will still lock the user based on failed verification attempts.
