<Callout type="info">
This feature is only available for user accounts that use [passwords](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) and [backup codes](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/multi-factor).
</Callout>

## Overview

User accounts are a vector for malicious attacks for many reasons from impersonation to collecting personally identifiable information (PII). One method is a "brute force" attack, where a script will attempt many different passwords to log into an account. One line of defense against these attacks is to temporarily deny attempts to log into accounts that attempt too many failed logins in a short period of time. Locking out login attempts disrupts the attack and makes the account a less attractive target.

### Clerk defaults
By default, all Clerk applications will lock user accounts after 100 failed login attempts and require a one hour cool down period before anyone can attempt to log into that account again. (While 100 attempts may seem like a lot to a human, it is very easy to reach this maximum for a bot!) You can modify these defaults, and Clerk users with admin roles override lockouts.

### What a locked out user sees

When a user exceeds the maximum login attempts, the Clerk [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component will inform them how long they've been locked out and to contact support for more information.

## Customize the max attempts before getting locked out and duration of lock out

1. In your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/), navigate to **User & Authentication > [Attack Protection](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/attack-protection)**.
2. To change the number of failed attempts before a user is locked out, under **Maximum attempts,** select "Custom attempts" and enter a new number of failed attempts allowed. (The default is 100 attempts.)
3. To change the duration, under **Duration,** select "Custom duration" and select the unit of time (minutes/hours/days/years) and enter the number of units you want lockouts to last.
4. Select "Apply changes" to apply your settings.

## Override a lockout

Users with admin roles can override lockouts through the Clerk dashboard.

1. In your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/), navigate to **[Users](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=users)**.
2. Locate the locked user by looking for a "locked" badge next to their username/email. 
3. Open the admin menu (three little dots).
4. Select "Unlock" to unlock the user account.
