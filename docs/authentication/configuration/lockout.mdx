## Prerequisites

User accounts this feature is available for must use: 

- [passwords](DASHBOARD LINK)
- [backup codes](DASHBOARD LINK)

## Overview

User accounts are a vector for malicious attacks for many reasons from impersonation to collecting personally identifiable information (PII). One method is a "brute force" attack, where a script will attempt many different passwords to log into an account. One line of defense against these attacks is to temporarily deny attempts to log into accounts that attempt too many failed logins in a short period of time. Locking out login attempts disrupts the attack and makes the account a less attractive target.

By default, all Clerk applications will lock user accounts after 100 failed login attempts and require a one hour cool down period before anyone can attempt to log into that account again. (While 100 attempts may seem like a lot to a human, it is very easy to reach this maximum for a bot!) You can modify these defaults and Clerk users with admin roles override lockouts.

## Lock a user after max attempts for a set period of time

In your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/), navigate to **User & Authentication > [Attack Protection](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/attack-protection)**.

The default is set to 100 failed login attempts. To change the number of attempts, under **Maximum attempts,** select "Custom attempts" and enter the number of failed attempts allowed before an account is locked.

### Set custom Duration

The default will lock a user from attempting to log in for one hour. To change the duration, under **Duration,** select "Custom duration" and select the unit of time (minutes/hours/days/years) and enter the number of units you want lockouts to last.
