Learn how to set up a social connection with Google in your Clerk application.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed. Simply navigate to the Social Connections page in your Clerk Dashboard, toggle on the LinkedIn option, and click Save.

In production instances, you must provide custom credentials, which includes generating your own Client ID and Client Secret using your Google Developer account. Don't worry, this guide will walk you through that process in just a few simple steps.

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Google Developer account. To create one, visit the [Google Cloud console](https://console.developers.google.com/).

## Configuration

<Steps>

### Create a Google application

</Steps>

First, go to the [Social Connections page](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=authentication/social) of your Clerk dashboard. From the list of OAuth vendors, enable Google. In the modal that opened, make sure **Use custom credentials** is enabled, and copy the value of the **Authorized redirect URI** field (you will have to paste this in the Google Console in a bit). Leave that window open as you will need to fill in the Client ID and Client Secret values that you will retrieve from the Google Cloud Platform console.

In a new window, go to your Google Cloud Platform console. Select your Google project (step 1 in the screenshot) and enable OAuth 2.0 support by following the official instructions on [how to set up up an OAuth 2.0 application](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en). In the **Authorized redirect URIs** setting, paste the value you copied from Clerk's Dashboard (see previous paragraph).

Once you have an OAuth client ID created, click on the newly created ID under **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs**. Copy the values of **Your Client ID** and **Your Client secret**; they will be needed in a minute.

Go back to your Clerk instance's Dashboard and in the modal that should be opened (see beginning of this section), paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values you obtained during the previous step.

Optionally, you can also set additional OAuth scopes that your application might need, according to your use case. More information about this feature can be found [here](https://clerk.com/docs/how-to/social-login-oauth), while the list of Google's available scopes can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes).

As a quick recap, if you followed this guide, you should have done the following:

- created an OAuth client ID in Google Cloud Platform console
- added the authorized redirect URI in that OAuth client ID, as provided by Clerk Dashboard
- set the proper Client ID and Client secret values in Clerk Dashboard, as provided by the Google Cloud Platform console

In the Clerk Dashboard configuration screen, you should end up with something like this:

![Client ID and Client secret filled in. Authorized redirect URI copied and entered into Google Cloud Platform console.](/docs/images/authentication-providers/google/8bf67be45ecccaf962a881fb09a61ed810e818cf-563x869.png)

Finally, click **Save** so that the settings are applied. Congratulations! Social connection with Google is now configured for your instance.
