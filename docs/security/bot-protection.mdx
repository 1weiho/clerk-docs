# Bot Protection

To protect your Sign Ups from Bots, Clerk leverages data from our CDN to determine whether a user attempting to sign up might be a bot or not.  

Clerk offers two captcha display modes:
- **Smart** - Will only show the captcha widget if bot traffic is suspected
- **Invisible** - Will never show the captcha widget

When set to **Smart**, users with suspected of being a bot will be shown a visible challenge (like clicking a checkbox), to verify they are not a bot. When set to **Invisible**, users suspected to be a bot will not be allowed to sign up, 

## Limitations
- Visual Captcha is primarily used in Web environments, and in some native contexts may not work
- If you are re-implementing Sign Ups with a [Custom Flow](/docs/custom-flows/overview) and have activated "Smart" display, then you need to ensure you have added a DOM node for the visible challenge. More in this [Custom Flow guide](/docs/custom-flows/bot-protection)
