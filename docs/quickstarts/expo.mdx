- Install `@clerk/expo`
- Set up your environment keys to test your app locally
- Add `<ClerkProvider />` to your application
- Protect specific pages with authentication
- Use Clerk hooks to enable users to sign in and out of your application

<Steps>

### Install `@clerk/clerk-expo`

To get started using Clerk with Expo, add the SDK to your project:

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install @clerk/clerk-expo
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn add @clerk/clerk-expo
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm add @clerk/clerk-expo
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

<Callout type="warning">
  Currently the `@clerk/expo` SDK only supports mobile app output. You can upvote the addition of Clerk supporting web output [here](https://feedback.clerk.com/roadmap/fb56a8db-763a-4e0d-a4b2-f8a453be195c).
</Callout>

### Set your environment variables

<SignedIn>

Add the following keys to your `.env` file. These keys can always be retrieved from your project's [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

</SignedIn>

<SignedOut>

1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
2. In the navigation sidebar, select [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
3. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.
4. Paste your keys into your `.env` file.

The final result should resemble the following:

</SignedOut>

```sh filename=".env"
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
```

Your `app.config.js` might look like this:

```js filename="app.config.js"
module.exports = {
  name: 'MyApp',
  version: '1.0.0',
  extra: {
    clerkPublishableKey: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
  },
};
```

### Add `<ClerkProvider>` and components to your app

All Clerk hooks and components must be children of the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component, which provides active session and user context.

You can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview). To get started, create a header for your users to sign in or out. To do this, you will use:

- [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
- [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.


```tsx filename="app.tsx"
import { SignedIn, SignedOut, useUser } from "@clerk/clerk-expo";
import { Link } from "expo-router";
import { Text, View } from "react-native";

export default function Page() {
  const user = useUser();

  return (
    <View>
      <SignedIn>{user.user?.firstName}</SignedIn>
      <SignedOut>
        <Link href="/sign-in">
          <Text>Sign In</Text>
        </Link>
      </SignedOut>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Protecting your pages

Clerk offers Control Components that allow you to protect your pages. In the example below, [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in) and [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/components/control/signed-out) control components are used.

```tsx filename="app.tsx"
import React from "react";
import { SafeAreaView, Text, StyleSheet } from "react-native";
import { ClerkProvider, SignedIn, SignedOut } from "@clerk/clerk-expo";
import Constants from "expo-constants"

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={Constants.expoConfig.extra.clerkPublishableKey}>
      <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
        <SignedIn>
          <Text>You are Signed in</Text>
        </SignedIn>
        <SignedOut>
          <Text>You are Signed out</Text>
        </SignedOut>
      </SafeAreaView>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: "#fff",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  },
});
```

Using expo requires you to create custom flows. Our quickstart guide shows you how to create a sign in and sign up flow using the `useSignIn` and `useSignUp` hooks.

<Callout type="warning">
  The following flows are built on the default instance settings for Clerk. If you have changed your instance settings, you may need to make changes to the following code.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Enable OTA updates

Though not required, it is recommended to implement over-the-air (OTA) updates in your Expo application. This enables you to easily roll out Clerk's feature updates and security patches as they're released without having to resubmit your application to mobile marketplaces.

See the [`expo-updates`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/updates) library to learn how to get started.
