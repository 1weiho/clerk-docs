# Use Clerk with React

Learn how to use clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your react application.

<Steps>

### Install @clerk/clerk-react

Once you have a React application ready, you need to install Clerk's React SDK. This gives you access to our prebuilt components and hooks for React applications.

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm installl @clerk/clerk-react
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn add @clerk/clerk-react
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm add @clerk/clerk-react
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set environment keys

Below is an example of an .env file. If you are signed into your Clerk Dashbaord, your keys should become visible by click on the eye icon.

<InjectKeys>

```sh filename=".env"
REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
```

</InjectKeys>

### Configure `<ClerkProvider />`

Clerk requires your React application to be wrapped in the [`<ClerkProvider />`](/docs/clerk-provider) component. The `<ClerkProvider />` component provides active session and user context to Clerk's hooks and other components.

```tsx filename="app.tsx"
import React from "react";
import "./App.css";
import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

if (!process.env.REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
  throw new Error("Missing Publishable Key")
}
const clerkPubKey = process.env.REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY;

function App() {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={clerkPubKey}>
      <div>Hello from clerk</div>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

</Steps>

# Great job!

You are all set to start running your application. 

For example, If a programmer wanted to run their local development server, he can start it by running 

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm sttart
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn sttart
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm sttart
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>
