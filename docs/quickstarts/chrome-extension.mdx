This tutorial only supports the email & password, email & email code, and SMS & SMS code [authentication options](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options). Email & email link, social sign in (OAuth), SAML, and invites are not supported.

<Steps>

### Install `@clerk/chrome-extension`

{/* TODO: Fill the link the reference */}
Clerk's [Chrome Extension SDK](#) gives you access to prebuilt components, React hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

Add the SDK to your project:

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn",  "pnpm" ]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install @clerk/chrome-extension
  npm run dev
  ```
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn add @clerk/chrome-extension
  yarn dev
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm add @clerk/chrome-extension
  pnpm dev
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set your environment variables

<SignedIn>

Add the following keys to your `.env` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.

</SignedIn>

<SignedOut>

1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
2. In the navigation sidebar, select [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
3. In the **Quick Copy** section, select **Chrome Extension** and copy your Clerk publishable and frontend API key.
4. Paste your keys into your `.env` file.

The final result should resemble the following:

</SignedOut>

  <InjectKeys>

  ```sh filename=".env.local"
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_FRONTEND_API={{fapi_url}}
  ```

  </InjectKeys>

### Add `<ClerkProvider>` to your app

All Clerk hooks and components must be children of the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component, which provides active session and user context.

To make this data available across your entire app, wrap your app in the `<ClerkProvider>` component. You **must** pass your publishable key as a prop to the `<ClerkProvider>` component.

```jsx filename="src/main.ts" {5, 7-12, 16, 18}
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.tsx";
import "./index.css";
import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/chrome-extension";

// Import your publishable key
const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY;

if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
  throw new Error("Missing Publishable Key");
}

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>
      <App />
    </ClerkProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

### Create a header with Clerk components

You can control which content signed in and signed out users can see with Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview). To get started, create a header for your users to sign in or out. With chrome extensions, you can also add this logic to a footer. To do this, you will use:

- [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
- [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
- [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button): A prebuilt component that comes styled out of the box to show the avatar from the account the user is signed in with.
- [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-in-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page or displays the sign-in modal.

```jsx filename="src/App.tsx" {2-7, 12-19}
import "./App.css";
import {
  SignInButton,
  SignedIn,
  SignedOut,
  UserButton,
} from "@clerk/chrome-extension";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <header className="header">
        <SignedOut>
          <SignInButton mode="modal" />
        </SignedOut>
        <SignedIn>
          <UserButton />
        </SignedIn>
      </header>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Load your Chrome Extension into your Chromium-based browser

The CRXJS plugin that you installed as a prerequisite, helps with Chrome Extension development. A significant benefit of the plugin is that while your application is running it will 'hot build' the application, so the `dist/` folder will be up to date. Without the extension you would need to use the build command after changes and then reload your Chrome Extension to see the changes. The plugin handles this for you. With your application running, please do the following:

1. Open Chrome or a Chromium-based browser and go to the 'Manage extensions' section.
2. Locate thee 'Developer mode' toggle, which is usually in the upper right corner.
3. Use the toggle to enable Developer mode, and once enabled there will be new buttons on the screen.
4. Click the 'Load unpacked' button, and navigate to where your project is located.
5. Locate the `dist/` folder, select it and then hit the 'Select' or 'OK' button.
6. Your extension will now be loaded and show in the Extensions screen.

### Test your Chrome Extension

At this point your new extension will work with email and one time passcode or sms with one time passcode. Open the extension popup, and you will see a Sign In Button. Clicking that will open the Sign In dialog and allow you to authenticate with one of the above authentication options.

### Next Steps

Developing a Chrome Extension poses several challenges. We have provided guides to help overcome those, and encourage you to go through each of them.

1. [Configure a Consistent Key](/docs/references/chrome-extension/configure-consistent-key)
2. [Enable sessionSyncWithTab](/docs/references/chrome-extension/syncsessionwithtab-configuration)
3. [Add React Router](/docs/references/chrome-extension/add-react-router)
