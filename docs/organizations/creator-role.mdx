# Creator Role

When a user creates a new Organization, that user is automatically added as the Organization's first member and assigned the default Role of `admin`. By default, the Admin Role is the Creator Role.

You can't **delete** an Organization Role if it's used as the Organization Creator Role. But, you **can** reassign the Creator Role to any other Role. For example, if you want to delete the Admin role, you will have to assign another Role the Creator Role.

To reassign the Creator Role, the target Role must have the following [System Permissions](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#system-permissions):

- Read members (`org:sys_memberships:read`)
- Manage members (`org:sys_memberships:manage`)
- Delete organization (`org:sys_profile:delete`)
