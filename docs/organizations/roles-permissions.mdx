# Roles and Permissions

You can use Clerk’s authorization logic to grant organization members access to different resources based on their Role.

## Roles

Roles determine a user's level of access to the organization. For each instance there are currently two default roles:

- **Admin (`org:admin`)** Offers full access to organization resources. Members with the admin role have all the [System Permissions](#system-permissions). They can fully manage organizations and organization memberships.
- **Member (`org:member`)** The default role for new organization members. Access to organization resources is limited to only Read members Permission by default. They cannot manage organizations and organization memberships but can view information about the organization and other members in it.

### The Creator Role

When a user creates a new Organization, that user is automatically added as the Organization's first member and assigned the default Role of `admin`. By default, `admin` is the Creator Role. 

<Callout type="warning">
You can't delete a Role if it's used as the Organization Creator Role. However, you can [reassign the Creator Role to another role](/docs/organizations/creator-role).
</Callout>

### Custom Roles

You can create up to 10 of custom Organization Roles per application instance to meet your application needs.

For example you can create a new Role of “moderator” (`org:moderator`) which can be used to group users who belong to a specific department of the Organization and have permission to manage other users.  

## Permissions

Permissions grant users privileged access to resources and operations like creating and deleting. Clerk supports two types of permissions, System and Custom. 

### System Permissions

Clerk has a set of System Permissions that power Clerk’s Frontend API and [Organization related Clerk Components](/docs/components/overview#organization-components). Clerk’s System Permissions consist of the following:

- Manage organization (`org:sys_profile:manage`)
- Delete organization (`org:sys_profile:delete`)
- Read members (`org:sys_memberships:read`)
- Manage members (`org:sys_memberships:manage`)
- Read domains (`org:sys_domains:read`)
- Manage domains (`org:sys_domains:manage`)

You can assign these System Permissions to Roles. 

### Custom Permissions

You can achieve some access and action privileges using Roles and System Permissions alone, but often you will need to specify what actions on a resource are/are not available to a user. You can create your own Permissions to compliment your app’s business logic, like restricting access of protected areas of your business for certain users. 

When creating a new Permission, follow the format `org:<resource>:<action>`. You can then assign the Permission to an existing Role.

For example, you could create a new Role “editor” (`org:editor`) and a new Permission “Edit posts” (`org:posts:edit`) which allows only users with this permission to edit your application’s posts. (You could also grant this Permission to the “moderator” Role if your app’s moderators are in charge of enforcing content policies for user generated posts!)
