# Expo and Clerk

<Callout type="warning">
  Currently the `@clerk/expo` SDK only supports mobile app output. You can upvote the addition of Clerk supporting web output [here](https://feedback.clerk.com/roadmap/fb56a8db-763a-4e0d-a4b2-f8a453be195c).
</Callout>

Clerk makes it simple to add authentication to your Expo application. This documentation covers the capabilities and methods available from Clerk's Expo SDK.

See [the quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/expo) to get started.

## Deploy Expo apps to production

There are a few caveats to deploying production Expo applications with Clerk. This section will guide you through addressing them.

### Add authorized redirect URLs

To redirect users after they successfully authenticate, you must add the redirect URLs you'll be using to your Clerk application with [the Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Redirect-URLs#operation/CreateRedirectURL).

The following example demonstrates how to add callback URLs to your application with a `POST` request, using your application's JWT as a Bearer Token:

```tsx
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/clerk-expo"

function Page() {
  const { getToken } = useAuth();

  async function createRedirectURL() {
    await fetch("https://api.clerk.com/v1/redirect_urls", {
      method: "POST",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${await getToken()}`
      body: {
        url: "myapp://oauth-native-callback"
      }
    })
  }
}
```
