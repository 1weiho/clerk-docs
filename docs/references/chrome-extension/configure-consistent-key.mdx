# Configure a consistent Chrome Extension key

Your Chrome Extension has it own unique key. This key can change while you are developing, unless you take steps to configure the extension. This guide will cover those steps so that your extension will have a stable, unchanging key.

<Steps>

### Register as a Chrome Web Store Developer

Visit the [Chrome Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard) to register. Google currently charges a $5 registration fee in order to complete your registration.

### Zip your extension

Create a zip file of the `dist/` folder. Make sure that you either have your project running if you're using the CRXJS plugin, or that you run your build script.

The exact method to zip files will depend on your operation system and configuration.

If you are using a mac, you can right click on the `dist/` folder and select **Compress "dist"**.

If you do not have a zip utility, [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) is a free applicaiton that you can use.

### Upload your extension

To upload your zipped extension to the Chrome Developer Dashboard:

1. Select the **New item** button in the top right of the dashboard.
1. Once uploaded, you can use the **Save draft** button and return later to configure the settings that you'll need in order to release your extension.

### Copy the public key

In the Chrome Developer Dashboard:

1. In the navigation sidebar, select **Package**.
2. Select **View public key**. A dialog will appear with your public key.
3. Copy the contents that are between `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----` and `-----END PUBLIC KEY-----`.

### Add the key to your `manifest.json`

In your application, open the `manifest.json` file. After the `"manifest_version": 3,` line, add a new line with the key of `key` and the value of the public key that you copied from the Chrome Developer Dashboard. Be sure to remove any newlines from the public key.

Your `manifest.json` file should look something like this:

```json filename="manifest.json"
{ // manifest.json
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "key": "ThisKeyIsGoingToBeVeryLong/go8GXC2u3UD9WI3MkmBgyiDPP2OreImEQhPvwpliioUMJmERZK3zPAx72z8MDvGp7Fx7ZlzuZpL4yyp4zXBI+MUhFGoqEh32oYnm4qkS4JpjWva5Ktn4YpAWxd4pSCVs8I4MZms20+yx5OlnlmWQEwQiiIwPPwG1e1jRw0Ak5duPpE3uysVGZXkGhC5FyOFM+oVXwc1kMqrrKnQiMJ3lgb59LjkX4z1cDNX3MomyUMJ+I+DaWC2VdHggB74BNANSd+zkPQeNKg3o7FetlDJya1bk8ofdNBARxHFMBtMXu/ONfCT3Q2kCY9gZDRktmNRiHG/1cXhkIcN1RWrbsCkwIDAQAB",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "action": { "default_popup": "index.html" }
}
```

### Validate the Extension ID

Your extension should now have a consistent and unchanging ID. To validate this:

1. At the top left of the [Chrome Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard), your extension ID will be displayed below the name of your extension.
1. In your Chrome browser, navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
1. Locate your extension in the list of extensions. The ID of your extension should match the ID displayed in the Chrome Developer Dashboard.
