# Configure a Consistent Chrome Extension Key

Your Chrome Extension has it own unique key. This key can change while you are developing, unless you take steps to configure the extension. This guide will cover those steps so that your extension will have a stable, unchanging key.

## Register as a Chrome Web Store Developer

You will need to visit the [Chrome Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard) to register. Google currently chargers a $5 registration fee in order to complete your registration.

## Zip and upload your extension

Create a zip file of the `dist/` folder. Make sure that you either have your project running if you're using the CRXJS plugin, or you run your build script. The exact method to zip files will depend on your operation system and configuration. If you do not have a zip utility, [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) is a free applicaiton you can install and use for this.

Upload your zipped extension to the Chrome Developer Dashboard. Once uploaded, you can use the 'Save draft' and then later return to configure the settings you'll need to release your extension.

## Copy the public key

1. Click on the 'Package' tab on the left side.
2. Click on 'View public key'. A dialog will appear with your public key.
3. Copy the contents that are between `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----` and `-----END PUBLIC KEY-----`.
4. Remove any line breaks so that the contents are one unbroken string of text.

## Add the key to your `manifest.json`

Open the manifest.json file from your project. After the `"manifest_version": 3,` line, add a new line with the key of `key` and paste the public key as the value.

```json
{ // manifest.json
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "key": "ThisKeyIsGoingToBeVeryLong/go8GGC2u3UD9WI3MkmBgyiDPP2OreImEQhPvwpliioUMJmERZK3zPAx72z8MDvGp7Fx7ZlzuZpL4yyp4zXBI+MUhFGoqEh32oYnm4qkS4JpjWva5Ktn4YpAWxd4pSCVs8I4MZms20+yx5OlnlmWQEwQiiIwPPwG1e1jRw0Ak5duPpE3uysVGZXkGhC5FyOFM+oVXwc1kMqrrKnQiMJ3lgh59LjkX4z1cDNX3MomyUMJ+I+DaWC2VdHggB74BNANSd+zkPQeNKg3o7FetlDJya1bk8ofdNBARxHFMBtMXu/ONfCT3Q2kCY9gZDRktmNRiHG/1cXhkIcN1RWrbsCkwIDAQAB",
}
```

## Validate the Extension ID

In the [Chrome Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard), locate the extension's ID. It will be located in the header under the name of the extension. Compare this ID with the ID of the extension in the extensions management section of your browser. The two IDs should match.

Your extension will now have a consistent and unchanging ID.
