# Clerk Chrome Extension SDK


## Chrome Extension Key

A Chrome Extension can be identified by its unique ID, in a similar way to how a website can be identified by its domain. You will need to explicitly configure your Chrome Extension's key or it will change often. If the key changes it can cause the Chrome Extension to fail.

The [Configure a Consistent Key](/docs/references/chrome-extension/configure-consistent-key) guide covers how to do this.


## `syncSessionWithTab`

The `syncSessionWithTab` feature will enable your Chrome Extension to sync the user's session with your web application. If you have enabled `syncSessionWithTab` then as soon as a user visits your web application while authenticated with it, the user will then be authenticated in the Chrome Extension as well.

The [syncSessionWithTab Configuration](/docs/references/chrome-extension/syncsessionwithtab-configuration) guide will cover configuring and enabling this feature.


## Add React Router

The [Add React Router](/docs/references/chrome-extension/add-react-router) guide covers implementing React Router for your extention.
