# Manual JWT verification

Your Clerk-generated [session tokens](/docs/backend-requests/resources/session-tokens) are essentially JWTs which are signed using your instance's private key and can be verified using your instance's public key. Depending on your architecture, these tokens will be in your backend requests either via a cookie named `__session` or via the Authorization header.

<Steps>

### Initialiaze a Clerk client

Initialize a Clerk client using the Clerk Secret Key and the Clerk Publishable Key provided in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.

### Verify request

To verify the request you should check that the `isSignedIn` attribute of the `clerkClient.authenticateRequest(request)` return value is `true`. The `request` parameter provided can be any object extending `Request`.

The `clerkClient.authenticateRequest(request)` executes the following steps:

1. Uses the instance Public Key to verify the token's signature (to manually find and use the public key check [here](#get-your-instances-public-key)).
2. Validates that the token is not expired by checking the `exp` ([Expiration time](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4)) and `nbf` ([Not before](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.5)) claims.
3. The `azp` claim in the Clerk Session JWT stands for authorized parties. If the `azp` claim exists, validate that it equals any of your known origins that are permitted to generate those tokens. This is an extra security check that we highly recommend that you do. Verifying the `azp` claim on the server side ensures that the session token is generated from the expected frontend application. For example, if you are permitting tokens retrieved from `http://localhost:3000`, then the `azp` claim should equal `http://localhost:3000`. You can also pass an array of strings like so: `['http://localhost:4003', 'https://clerk.dev']`. If the `azp` claim does not exist, then you can skip this step.

If the above process is successful, it means that the user is signed in to your application and you can consider them authenticated. You can also retrieve the session ID and user ID out of the token's claims.

</Steps>

## Example usage

In the example below, the [@clerk/backend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clerk/backend) library is used to verify the token signature.

```tsx filename="pages/api/token-example.ts"
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend';

const clerkClient = createClerkClient({
  // jwtKey: to manually pass your public key,
  secretKey: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY,
  publishableKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
});

const headers = { 'content-type': 'application/json' };

export default async function handler(req: NextRequest) {
  const requestState = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest(req);

  if (!requestState.isSignedIn){
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ error: requestState.message}),
      {
        status: 401,
        headers
      },
    );
  }
  
  const auth = requestState.toAuth();
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({ auth }),
    {
      status: 200,
      headers
    },
  );
}
```

If the token is valid, the response will return a JSON object that looks similar to the one below. You can use this to validate the `exp` and `azp` claims, as mentioned in the [steps above](#verify-request). Once the token is completely validated, you then have a valid session ID (`sid`) and user ID (`sub`) that you can use in your application.

```json
{
    "auth": {
        "sessionClaims": {
            "azp": "http://localhost:3000",
            "exp": 1687906422,
            "iat": 1687906362,
            "iss": "https://magical-marmoset-51.clerk.accounts.dev",
            "nbf": 1709133291,
            "sid": "sess_2Ro7e2IxrffdqBboq8KfB6eGbIy",
            "sub": "user_2RfWKJREkjKbHZy0Wqa5qrHeAnb"
        },
        "sessionId": "sess_2Ro7e2IxrffdqBboq8KfB6eGbIy",
        "userId": "user_2RfWKJREkjKbHZy0Wqa5qrHeAnb"
    }
}
```

## Get your instance's public key

There are three ways to obtain your public key:

1. Using the Backend API in JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) format at the following endpoint [https://api.clerk.com/v1/jwks](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/JWKS#operation/GetJWKS).

2. Using the Frontend API in JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) format at the following endpoint `https://<YOUR_FRONTEND_API>/.well-known/jwks.json`. This can be obtained from the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page. Scroll down and click on **Advanced** and in the **JWT public key** section, copy the **JWKS URL**.

3. Using the PEM public key provided in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page. Scroll down and click on **Advanced** and in the **JWT public key** section, copy the **PEM public key**. This option should only be used as a fallback for when the first two options are not available.
