# Clerk Guides

Clerk provides a suite of [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) for getting your app authenticated fast, the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/) for managing your users' accounts and identies, and a [backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api) for tailoring custom flows to your design and app needs. These guides show you how to use these features together to build delightful, safe, and secure experiences.
