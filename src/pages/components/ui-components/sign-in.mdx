## `<SignIn />`

The `<SignIn/>` component renders a UI for signing in users.The functionality of the `<SignIn/>` component are controlled by the instance settings you specify in your Clerk Dashboard. You can further customize your `<SignIn/>` component by passing additional properties at the time of rendering.

Here's an example of what the component looks like once it's rendered:

![sign in component](https://clerk.dev/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fe1ql88v4%2Fproduction%2Faa2aa7423978fb66e9791b526c6db2ff1fb8a778-960x1100.png%3Ffit%3Dmax%26auto%3Dformat&w=640&q=75)

## Usage

<Tabs items={['Next.js', 'React', "javascript"]}>

<Tab>
Using the Next.js optional catch all route, you can embed the `<SignIn/>` component. This allows you to redirect the user inside your application and handle any redirects.

```jsx filename="/pages/sign-in/[[...index]].[jsx/tsx]"
import { SignIn } from "@clerk/nextjs";
const SignInPage = () => (
  <SignIn path="/sign-in" routing="path" signUpUrl="/sign-up" />
);
export default SignInPage;
```

</Tab>
<Tab>
The mounted `<SignIn/>` component uses hash-based routing by default. As the sign in flow progresses, the hash portion of the URL will update to reflect the current step. An example of such a URL would be example.com/sign-in#/factor-one.

```jsx filename="sign-in.jsx"
import { SignIn } from "@clerk/clerk-react";
// Render the sign in component in your
// custom sign in page.
function SignInPage() {
  return <SignIn />;
}
```


Below is an example that uses path-based routing to mount the `<SignIn/>` component under the "/sign-in" path. The Clerk React snippet uses the popular React Router library, but it can be easily adapted to use the routing library of your choice.

```jsx filename="App.js"
import { ClerkProvider, SignedIn, SignIn } from "@clerk/clerk-react";
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
function PublicPage() {
  return <h1>Public page</h1>;
}
function ProtectedPage() {
  return <h1>Protected page</h1>;
}
function ClerkProviderWithRoutes() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  return (
    <ClerkProvider
      publishableKey="clerk-pub-key"
      navigate={(to) => navigate(to)}
    >
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<PublicPage />} />
        <Route
          path="/sign-in"
          element={<SignIn routing="path" path="/sign-in" />}
        />
        <Route
          path="/protected"
          element={
            <SignedIn>
              <ProtectedPage />
            </SignedIn>
          }
        />
      </Routes>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <ClerkProviderWithRoutes />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
export default App;
```

</Tab>
<Tab>
```js
// Mount the sign in component inside the HTML element
// with id "sign-in".
window.Clerk.mountSignIn(
  document.getElementById("sign-in")
);
// Open the sign in component as a modal.
window.Clerk.openSignIn();
````
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Override URLs

<Tabs items={['Next.js', 'React', "javascript"]}>
By default, the `<SignIn/>` component will use the Clerk Hosted Pages URL for sign ups. You can override this at runtime, by passing the signUpURL property to the component.

Similarly, you can override the redirect URL after successful sign ins by providing the afterSignIn property to the component.

Both URL property values can be either relative paths (like /home) or full URLs (like https://my-domain.com/home).

<Tab>

```jsx filename="/pages/sign-in/[[...index]].[jsx/tsx]"
import { SignIn } from "@clerk/nextjs";
const SignInPage = () => (
  <SignIn
    path="/sign-in"
    routing="path"
    signUpUrl="/sign-up"
    afterSignInUrl={"url-you-choose"}
  />
);
export default SignInPage;
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```jsx filename="sign-in.js"
import { SignIn } from "@clerk/clerk-react";
// Root path points to your homepage and sign up URL
// is the full URL to your sign up page. These can be
// either relative paths or full URLs.
import { rootPath, signUpURL } from "src/routes";
// Render the sign in component in your custom sign in
// page overriding the pre-configured URLs.
function SignInPage() {
  return <SignIn afterSignInUrl={rootPath} signUpUrl={signUpURL} />;
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab>
```js
    // Mount the sign in component inside the
    // HTML element with id "sign-in".
    window.Clerk.mountSignIn(
      document.getElementById("sign-in"),
      {
        afterSignIn: "/home",
        signUpURL: "/sign-up",
      },
    );
    // Open the sign in component as a modal.
    window.Clerk.openSignIn({
    afterSignInUrl: "/home",
    signUpUrl: "/sign-up",
    });
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

    },
    {
